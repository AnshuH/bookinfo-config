# We assume the base for bookinfo-system might be implicitly defined by the Helm charts
# or you might have a base kustomization for bookinfo-system if common values are factored out.
# For now, we'll directly include helmCharts similar to dev.

helmCharts:
- name: bookinfo-service
  releaseName: bookinfo-service
  version: 0.1.2 # Ensure this matches the chart version you want for prod
  repo: https://muralikrishnagk.github.io/bookinfo-charts
  valuesFile: bookinfo-service/values.yaml # Prod-specific values

- name: bookinfo-processor
  releaseName: bookinfo-processor
  version: 0.1.2 # Ensure this matches the chart version you want for prod
  repo: https://muralikrishnagk.github.io/bookinfo-charts
  valuesFile: bookinfo-processor/values.yaml # Prod-specific values
